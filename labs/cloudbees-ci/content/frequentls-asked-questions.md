### Waiting the provisioning of your managed controller
While your team is being provisioned, you might see that your infrastructure is disconnected, or you might get an HTTP 503 Service Unavailable server error response code indicating that the server is not ready to handle the request.

Itâ€™s not uncommon to wait several minutes for all your resources to be allocated, especially if there are many participants in the workshop.

### Hibernation

If you are returning to the workshop after a time away, your team infrastructure may be hibernating. 

The classic view (left image) shows a list of teams visible to you, depending on your permissions, with a server icon for each team. If the infrastructure is hibernating, the server icon is superimposed with a pause button. Here one server is paused and one is not. Click your team name to wake it. 

The hibernation message from CloudBees CI is shown at right, and the bottom is the message while the managed controller is starting back up.
