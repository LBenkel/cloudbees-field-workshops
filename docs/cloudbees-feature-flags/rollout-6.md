Niche data platforms like Google Analytics make it easy to wire in the appropriate metrics and monitor the results. But more importantly, these tools provide an open library on how to communicate and push data to their systems. So, in addition to their out of the box metrics, a company can define and use data that is relevant and meets the needs for a defined test.
