# CloudBees CI Overview

 CloudBees CI enables developers to spend less time on admin tasks and more time coding. 
 
 - Increase efficiency and speed to release. Decrease context-switching.  
 - Provide repeatable components utilizing Configuration as Code. 
 - Speed your time to build with streamlined and self-service ***managed controller*** ( team specific Jenkins instances) provisioning.  
 - Dynamically share build agents across many controllers allowing for increased performance with decreased cost.
 - Reduce infrastructure costs by automatically hibernating idle resources.
